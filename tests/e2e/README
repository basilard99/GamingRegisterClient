I might not be doing this according to common Javascript practices; that seems
to be a bit ephemeral. My goal with this is to ensure that the system works
according to the way my mind works based on my previous experience.

The main question asked, as with all testing, is "Does this work as I expect?"
The second question asked, somewhat less often, is "What does this do?"

The e2e tests have a different audience than unit tests, so are written in a
language that an end user/BA/etc would understand.
